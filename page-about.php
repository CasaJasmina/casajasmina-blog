      <p>
        "Casa Jasmina" is a two-year pilot project in the business space of domestic electronic networking, or, "the Internet of Things in the Home." </br> Our goal is to integrate traditional Italian skills in furniture and interior design with emergent skills in Italian open-source electronics.
      </p>
      <p>

        The project is a showplace inside the large industrial building already shared by <a href="http://www.toolboxoffice.it/">Toolbox</a> Co-Working, <a href="http://fablabtorino.org/">Fablab Torino</a> and <a href="http://local.arduino.cc/torino/">Officine Arduino</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
       Casa Jasmina showplace has three main functions:
     </p>

     <p>
      <ul>

        <li>
         A real-world testbed for hacks, experiments and innovative IoT and digital fabrication projects.
       </li>
       <li>
         A curated space for public exposure of excellent artifacts and best practices.
       </li>

       <li>
         A guest-house for occasional visitors to Toolbox, Officine Arduino and 
         Fablab Torino.
       </li>
 
     </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
     We are building Casa Jasmina  in order to encourage industries that will create tomorrow's living spaces. <br>Casa Jasmina is an incubator, and its purpose is industry-boosting in the Torino and Piemonte IoT space. The successors of the Casa Jasmina  project will be real homes with real, innovative products inside.
